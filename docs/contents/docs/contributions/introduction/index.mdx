## Introduction

Welcome to the Lucidity App setup guide! This document will help you get the app running on your device in no time. Follow the steps carefully to load the application in a sandbox environment and on a physical device.

### Getting Started

To open the Lucidity App within a sandbox environment, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the Lucidity repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash {7} 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AyubsWrld/Lucidity
```

#### 2. Install the [Expo GO](https://expo.dev/go) Mobile App

Download the **Expo GO** mobile application on your phone. This will enable you to run the Lucidity App in a sandbox environment on your mobile device.

#### 3. Run the Setup Commands

Once the repository is cloned, open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and execute the following commands:

```bash {7} 
cd Lucidity
npm install
npm expo start 
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Loading the Application onto a Physical Device

After running the commands above, the **Metro Bundler** will generate a QR code in your terminal. Follow these steps to load the app onto your physical device:

1. **Scan the QR code** using the Expo GO app on your phone.
2. The Lucidity App will automatically open in the Expo GO environment.

## Code Example

Below is an example code block that demonstrates how to structure a theme provider within your application. 

```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import ThemeProvider from "./theme-provider";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body className="container">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
``` 
*/}
