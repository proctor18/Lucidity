### 1.1 Abstract
___
-   In today’s fast-paced educational environment, students and educators alike are constantly seeking efficient ways to connect for academic support. While there are numerous tutoring platforms available, there is a need for a comprehensive app that caters specifically to students who value convenience, flexibility, and personalized learning experiences. Our team aims to create an intuitive tutoring app that connects students with qualified tutors across various subjects and grade levels, enhancing the accessibility and quality of academic support.
    
-   This app will serve a diverse range of users, including students from grades 1-12, university students, professional tutors and admin users. It will feature essential functionalities such as real-time session booking, an integrated messaging system, and robust scheduling options. Students will be able to search for tutors based on subject expertise, grade level, and availability, while tutors will have tools to manage their schedules and track their sessions.
    
-   Designed for use on both Android and iOS devices, this app will utilize modern technologies such as in-app notifications, and real-time chat. Our goal is to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience that empowers students to take control of their education and facilitates effective, personalized learning experiences for all users.

### 1.2 Background
____
-   Education is evolving, with more students seeking personalized learning experiences beyond the traditional classroom setting. Despite the abundance of tutoring services available, many students and tutors face challenges in finding and managing sessions efficiently. The need for a streamlined, intuitive platform that connects students with the right tutors in real-time is evident.
    
-   Our research has shown that existing tutoring apps often lack the flexibility, user experience, and comprehensive features required by both students and tutors. This is especially true for those who want to book sessions across multiple subjects or need continuous support outside scheduled sessions. To address these gaps, we are developing a new tutoring app that offers a rich set of features designed with user convenience and effective learning in mind.
    
-   In the academic year of 2024, our team conducted a survey and interviews with students, tutors, and educational institutions to understand the pain points of existing platforms. The findings highlighted the demand for better session management, real-time communication, and integrated note-taking and recording functionalities. These insights have guided the design and development of our tutoring app, which aims to transform how students and tutors interact and engage with each other.

### 1.3 Background
____
-   Our primary objective is to develop a robust and user-friendly tutoring app compatible with both Android and iOS devices. This app will enable seamless interaction between students and tutors, providing a platform for booking, managing, and conducting tutoring sessions with ease.
    
-   Key features will include a searchable tutor database, real-time session booking and cancellation, integrated chat for pre-session communication, and a virtual classroom environment with video and whiteboard functionalities. Additionally, we will implement a ratings and feedback system to maintain a high standard of quality and help users make informed decisions.
    
-   By the end of the development cycle, we aim to have a fully functional Beta version available for testing. This will allow us to gather feedback from students, tutors, and educational professionals to refine the app’s user experience and feature set. Our ultimate goal is to create a versatile, all-in-one tutoring solution that enhances learning outcomes and fosters meaningful educational relationships.
